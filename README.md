Objective:
Create an interactive BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator that makes use of arithmetic operations and Flutter UI elements like Slider, Container, Text, etc.
This assignment is focused on helping you understand user interaction, real-time calculations, and updating the UI using user inputs.
Task: Design a Fun & Interactive BMI Calculator App
Build a Flutter app where users can input their height and weight using sliders or input fields, and then the app calculates and displays the BMI in real-time.
Requirements:
Use Arithmetic Logic:
Apply the formula:

Update BMI whenever the slider value changes.
Use Flutter Widgets Creatively:
Slider for weight and height
Text widgets to show selected values
Container to display the calculated BMI
setState() to dynamically update values

Add Interactivity:
As the user moves the slider, the BMI should update instantly.
Optionally show the BMI category (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)
Make It Visually Appealing:
Use background colors or emojis to reflect BMI categories.
